102shows is an LED strip driver for the Raspberry Pi and also a collection of lightshows.
These lightshows can be controlled over your home network via MQTT.
And for those who do not prefer sending raw MQTT messages from the console, there is a
(`Node-RED <https://nodered.org>`__-based) web interface.
Its responsive layout makes it ideal for smart phones, tablets and computers.
